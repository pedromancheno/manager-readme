# Manager README

## Motivation for this document

This document is just a quick rundown of who I am as a manager and engineer and how I like to work. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution, but it's what works for me and I hope it gives you a better idea what I care about.

## My role

As an Engineering Manager, I recognize that my role is multifaceted and can vary depending on the current [stage of development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development) for my team. However, some core responsibilities consistently stand out.

### Supporting the individuals
As an Engineering Manager, my role is primarily supportive in nature. I understand that any positive impact I have on the individuals in my team will ultimately impact the organization as a whole. With this in mind, my primary focus is always to make things easier for the engineers on my team. To achieve this, I prioritize the following:

* Removing blockers, clarifying uncertainties, and providing context to enable them to deliver their best work
* Supporting them in defining and pursuing their professional goals, both through challenges and encouragement
* Acting as their advocate and amplifying their voice within the organization.

### Building a great culture
Another important aspect of my role is being a driving force in building a strong Engineering Culture. To achieve this, I focus on the following:

* Participating actively in the hiring process to build a diverse team of talented engineers
* Working closely with my peers to establish high standards for the engineering teams
* Fostering an environment of continuous learning and professional development in the engineering area

### Supporting the entire organization
Lastly, as an Engineering Manager, I play a critical role in interfacing with other areas outside of engineering, such as product and design, among others. This involves:

* Facilitating effective communication between the engineering team and other areas
* Gaining a thorough understanding of the challenges faced by other areas and identifying opportunities for the engineering team to make a positive impact
* Promoting strong cross-functional collaboration within the team.
